This project is a simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Game of Life is a cellular automaton where cells on a grid live or die based on specific rules. In this project, each cell can be toggled alive or dead by clicking, and the game progresses automatically with each generation. The grid is rendered dynamically on a web page, allowing users to interact with the simulation.![Uploading game_of_life.gifâ€¦]()
